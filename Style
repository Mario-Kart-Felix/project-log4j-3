Apache Log4j Code Style Guidelines
Introduction
This document serves as the complete definition of the Log4j project's coding standards for source code in the Java™ Programming Language. It originated from the Google coding standards but incorporates modifications that reflect the desires of the Log4j community.

Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic issues of formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as well. However, this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that we follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly enforceable (whether by human or tool).

Terminology notes
In this document, unless otherwise clarified:

The term class is used inclusively to mean an "ordinary" class, enum class, interface or annotation type (@interface).
The term comment always refers to implementation comments. We do not use the phrase "documentation comments", instead using the common term "Javadoc."
Other "terminology notes" will appear occasionally throughout the document.

Guide notes
Example code in this document is non-normative. That is, while the examples are in Log4j Style, they may not illustrate the only stylish way to represent the code. Optional formatting choices made in examples should not be enforced as rules.

Source File Basics
File name
The source file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class it contains, plus the .java extension.

2.2 File encoding: UTF-8
Source files are encoded in UTF-8.

Special characters
Whitespace characters
Aside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character (0x20) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file. This implies that:

All other whitespace characters in string and character literals are escaped.
Tab characters are not used for indentation.
Special escape sequences
For any character that has a special escape sequence (\b, \t, \n, \f, \r, \", \' and \\), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. \012) or Unicode (e.g. \u000a) escape.

Non-ASCII characters
For the remaining non-ASCII characters, either the actual Unicode character (e.g. ∞) or the equivalent Unicode escape (e.g. \u221e) is used, depending only on which makes the code easier to read and understand.

Tip: In the Unicode escape case, and occasionally even when actual Unicode characters are used, an explanatory comment can be very helpful.

Examples:

Example	Discussion
String unitAbbrev = "μs";	Best: perfectly clear even without a comment.
String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs"; // "μs"	Allowed, but there's no reason to do this.
String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs"; // Greek letter mu, "s"	Allowed, but awkward and prone to mistakes.
String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs";	Poor: the reader has no idea what this is.
return '\ufeff' + content; // byte order mark	Good: use escapes for non-printable characters, and comment if necessary.
Tip: Never make your code less readable simply out of fear that some programs might not handle non-ASCII characters properly. If that should happen, those programs are broken and they must be fixed.

Source file structure
A source file consists of, in order:

Apache license
Package statement
Import statements
Exactly one top-level class
Exactly one blank line separates each section that is present.

Apache License
The Apache license belongs here. No other license should appear. Other licenses that apply should be referenced in a NOTICE file

Package statement
The package statement is not line-wrapped. The column limit (Column limit: 120) does not apply to package statements.

Import statements
No wildcard imports in the main tree
Wildcard imports, static or otherwise, are not used.

Static wildcard imports in the test tree
Wildcard static imports are encouraged for test imports like JUnit, EasyMock, and Hamcrest.

No line-wrapping
Import statements are not line-wrapped. The column limit (Column limit: 120) does not apply to import statements.

Ordering and spacing
Import statements are divided into the following groups, in this order, with each group separated by a single blank line:

java
javax
org
com
All static imports in a single group
Within a group there are no blank lines, and the imported names appear in ASCII sort order. (Note: this is not the same as the import statements being in ASCII sort order; the presence of semicolons warps the result.)

IDE settings for ordering imports automatically can be found in the source distributions under src/ide. For example:

Eclipse: src/ide/eclipse/4.3.2/organize-imports.importorder
IntelliJ: src/ide/Intellij/13/IntellijSettings.jar
Class declaration
Exactly one top-level class declaration
Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.

Class member ordering
Class members should be grouped in the following order>.

static variables grouped in the order shown below. Within a group variables may appear in any order.
public
protected
package
private
instance variables grouped in the order shown below. Within a group variables may appear in any order
public
protected
package
private
constructors
methods may be specified in the following order but may appear in another order if it improves the clarity of the program.
public
protected
package
private
Overloads: never split
When a class has multiple constructors, or multiple methods with the same name, these appear sequentially, with no intervening members.

Formatting
Terminology Note: block-like construct refers to the body of a class, method or constructor. Note that, by array initializers, any array initializer may optionally be treated as if it were a block-like construct.

Braces
Braces are used where optional
Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.

Nonempty blocks: K & R style
Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style ("Egyptian brackets") for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs:

No line break before the opening brace.
Line break after the opening brace.
Line break before the closing brace.
Line break after the closing brace if that brace terminates a statement or the body of a method, constructor or named class. For example, there is no line break after the brace if it is followed by else or a comma.
Example:

      return new MyClass() {
          @Override public void method() {
              if (condition()) {
                  try {
                      something();
                  } catch (ProblemException e) {
                      recover();
                  }
              }
          }
      };
    
A few exceptions for enum classes are given in Section 4.8.1, Enum classes.

Empty blocks: may be concise
An empty block or block-like construct may be closed immediately after it is opened, with no characters or line break in between ({}), unless it is part of a multi-block statement (one that directly contains multiple blocks: if/else-if/else or try/catch/finally).

Example:

      void doNothing() {}
    
Block indentation: +4 spaces
Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by four spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block. (See the example in Section 4.1.2, Nonempty blocks: K & R Style.)

One statement per line
Each statement is followed by a line-break.

Column limit: 120
The column limit for Log4j is 120 characters. Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped, as explained in Line-wrapping.

Exceptions:

Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible (for example, a long URL in Javadoc, or a long JSNI method reference).
package and import statements (see Package statement and Import statements).
Command lines in a comment that may be cut-and-pasted into a shell.
Line-wrapping
Terminology Note: When code that might otherwise legally occupy a single line is divided into multiple lines, typically to avoid overflowing the column limit, this activity is called line-wrapping.

There is no comprehensive, deterministic formula showing exactly how to line-wrap in every situation. Very often there are several valid ways to line-wrap the same piece of code.

Tip: Extracting a method or local variable may solve the problem without the need to line-wrap.

Where to break
The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a higher syntactic level. Also:

When a line is broken at a non-assignment operator the break comes before the symbol. (Note that this is not the same practice used in Google style for other languages, such as C++ and JavaScript.)
This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols: the dot separator (.), the ampersand in type bounds (<T extends Foo & Bar>), and the pipe in catch blocks (catch (FooException | BarException e)).
When a line is broken at an assignment operator the break typically comes after the symbol, but either way is acceptable.
This also applies to the "assignment-operator-like" colon in an enhanced for ("foreach") statement.
A method or constructor name stays attached to the open parenthesis (() that follows it.
A comma (,) stays attached to the token that precedes it.
Indent continuation lines at least +8 spaces
When line-wrapping, each line after the first (each continuation line) is indented at least +8 from the original line.

When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied beyond +8 as desired. In general, two continuation lines use the same indentation level if and only if they begin with syntactically parallel elements.

The section on Horizontal alignment addresses the discouraged practice of using a variable number of spaces to align certain tokens with previous lines.

Whitespace
Vertical Whitespace
A single blank line appears:

Between consecutive members (or initializers) of a class: fields, constructors, methods, nested classes, static initializers, instance initializers.
Exception: A blank line between two consecutive fields (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to create logical groupings of fields.
Within method bodies, as needed to create logical groupings of statements.
Optionally before the first member or after the last member of the class (neither encouraged nor discouraged).
As required by other sections of this document (such as Import statements).
Multiple consecutive blank lines are permitted, but never required (or encouraged).

Horizontal whitespace
Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from literals, comments and Javadoc, a single ASCII space also appears in the following places only.

Separating any reserved word, such as if, for or catch, from an open parenthesis (() that follows it on that line
Separating any reserved word, such as else or catch, from a closing curly brace (}) that precedes it on that line
Before any open curly brace ({), with two exceptions:
String[][] x = {{"foo"}}; (no space is required between {{, by item 8 below)
On both sides of any binary or ternary operator. This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:
the ampersand in a conjunctive type bound: <T extends Foo & Bar>
the pipe for a catch block that handles multiple exceptions: catch (FooException | BarException e)
the colon (:) in an enhanced for ("foreach") statement
After ,:; or the closing parenthesis ()) of a cast
On both sides of the double slash (//) that begins an end-of-line comment. Here, multiple spaces are allowed, but not required.
Between the type and variable of a declaration: List<String> list
Optional just inside both braces of an array initializer
new int[] {5, 6} and new int[] { 5, 6 } are both valid
Note: This rule never requires or forbids additional space at the start or end of a line, only interior space.

Horizontal alignment: never required
Terminology Note: Horizontal alignment is the practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.

This practice is permitted, but is never required by Google Style. It is not even required to maintain horizontal alignment in places where it was already used.

Here is an example without alignment, then using alignment:

      private int x; // this is fine
      private Color color; // this too

      private int   x;      // permitted, but future edits
      private Color color;  // may leave it unaligned
    
Tip: Alignment can aid readability, but it creates problems for future maintenance. Consider a future change that needs to touch just one line. This change may leave the formerly-pleasing formatting mangled, and that is allowed. More often it prompts the coder (perhaps you) to adjust whitespace on nearby lines as well, possibly triggering a cascading series of reformattings. That one-line change now has a "blast radius." This can at worst result in pointless busywork, but at best it still corrupts version history information, slows down reviewers and exacerbates merge conflicts.

Grouping parentheses: recommended
Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when author and reviewer agree that there is no reasonable chance the code will be misinterpreted without them, nor would they have made the code easier to read. It is not reasonable to assume that every reader has the entire Java operator precedence table memorized.

Specific constructs
Enum classes
After each comma that follows an enum constant, a line-break is optional.

An enum class with no methods and no documentation on its constants may optionally be formatted as if it were an array initializer (see array initializers).

      private enum Suit { CLUBS, HEARTS, SPADES, DIAMONDS }
    
Since enum classes are classes, all other rules for formatting classes apply.

Variable declarations
One variable per declaration
Every variable declaration (field or local) declares only one variable: declarations such as int a, b; are not used.

Declared when needed, initialized as soon as possible
Local variables are not habitually declared at the start of their containing block or block-like construct. Instead, local variables are declared close to the point they are first used (within reason), to minimize their scope. Local variable declarations typically have initializers, or are initialized immediately after declaration.

Arrays
Array initializers: can be "block-like"
Any array initializer may optionally be formatted as if it were a "block-like construct." For example, the following are all valid (not an exhaustive list):

      new int[] {           new int[] {
        0, 1, 2, 3            0,
      }                       1,
                              2,
      new int[] {             3,
        0, 1,               }
        2, 3
      }                     new int[]
                                {0, 1, 2, 3}
    
No C-style array declarations
The square brackets form a part of the type, not the variable: String[] args, not String args[].

Switch statements
Terminology Note: Inside the braces of a switch block are one or more statement groups. Each statement group consists of one or more switch labels (either case FOO: or default:), followed by one or more statements.

Indentation
As with any other block, the contents of a switch block are indented +2.

After a switch label, a newline appears, and the indentation level is increased +2, exactly as if a block were being opened. The following switch label returns to the previous indentation level, as if a block had been closed.

Fall-through: commented
Within a switch block, each statement group either terminates abruptly (with a break, continue, return or thrown exception), or is marked with a comment to indicate that execution will or might continue into the next statement group. Any comment that communicates the idea of fall-through is sufficient (typically // fall through). This special comment is not required in the last statement group of the switch block. Example:

      switch (input) {
        case 1:
        case 2:
          prepareOneOrTwo();
          // fall through
        case 3:
          handleOneTwoOrThree();
          break;
      default:
          handleLargeNumber(input);
      }
    
The default case is present
Each switch statement includes a default statement group, even if it contains no code.

Annotations
Annotations applying to a class, method or constructor appear immediately after the documentation block, and each annotation is listed on a line of its own (that is, one annotation per line). These line breaks do not constitute line-wrapping (Section 4.5, Line-wrapping), so the indentation level is not increased. Example:

      @Override
      @Nullable
      public String getNameIfPresent() { ... }
    
Exception: A single parameterless annotation may instead appear together with the first line of the signature, for example:

      @Override public int hashCode() { ... }
    
Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block, but in this case, multiple annotations (possibly parameterized) may be listed on the same line; for example:

      @Partial @Mock DataLoader loader;
    
There are no specific rules for formatting parameter and local variable annotations.

Comments
Block comment style
Block comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code. They may be in /* ... */ style or // ... style. For multi-line /* ... */ comments, subsequent lines must start with * aligned with the * on the previous line.

      /*
       * This is          // And so           /* Or you can
       * okay.            // is this.          * even do this. */
       */
    
Comments are not enclosed in boxes drawn with asterisks or other characters.

Tip: When writing multi-line comments, use the /* ... */ style if you want automatic code formatters to re-wrap the lines when necessary (paragraph-style). Most formatters don't re-wrap lines in // ... style comment blocks.

Modifiers
Class and member modifiers, when present, appear in the order recommended by the Java Language Specification:

      public protected private abstract static final transient volatile synchronized native strictfp
    
Numeric Literals
long-valued integer literals use an uppercase L suffix, never lowercase (to avoid confusion with the digit 1). For example, 3000000000L rather than 3000000000l.

Naming
Rules common to all identifiers
Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and in two cases noted below, underscores. Thus each valid identifier name is matched by the regular expression \w+ .

In Google Style special prefixes or suffixes, like those seen in the examples name_, mName, s_name and kName, are not used.

Rules by identifier type
Package names
Package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words simply concatenated together (no underscores). For example, com.example.deepspace, not com.example.deepSpace or com.example.deep_space.

Class names
Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.

Class names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, Character or ImmutableList. Interface names may also be nouns or noun phrases (for example, List), but may sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example, Readable).

There are no specific rules or even well-established conventions for naming annotation types.

Test classes are named starting with the name of the class they are testing, and ending with Test. For example, HashTest or HashIntegrationTest.

Method names
Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.

Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example, sendMessage or stop.

Underscores may appear in JUnit test method names to separate logical components of the name. One typical pattern is test<MethodUnderTest>_<state>, for example testPop_emptyStack. There is no One Correct Way to name test methods.

Constant names
Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores. But what is a constant, exactly?

Every constant is a static final field, but not all static final fields are constants. Before choosing constant case, consider whether the field really feels like a constant. For example, if any of that instance's observable state can change, it is almost certainly not a constant. Merely intending to never mutate the object is generally not enough. Examples:

      // Constants
      static final int NUMBER = 5;
      static final ImmutableList<String> NAMES = ImmutableList.of("Ed", "Ann");
      static final Joiner COMMA_JOINER = Joiner.on(',');  // because Joiner is immutable
      static final SomeMutableType[] EMPTY_ARRAY = {};
      enum SomeEnum { ENUM_CONSTANT }

      // Not constants
      static String nonFinal = "non-final";
      final String nonStatic = "non-static";
      static final Set<String> mutableCollection = new HashSet<String>();
      static final ImmutableSet<SomeMutableType> mutableElements = ImmutableSet.of(mutable);
      static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.getName());
      static final String[] nonEmptyArray = {"these", "can", "change"};
    
These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.

Non-constant field names
Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.

These names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, computedValues or index.

Parameter names
Parameter names are written in lowerCamelCase.

One-character parameter names should be avoided.

Local variable names
Local variable names are written in lowerCamelCase, and can be abbreviated more liberally than other types of names.

However, one-character names should be avoided, except for temporary and looping variables.

Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, and should not be styled as constants.

Type variable names
Each type variable is named in one of two styles:

A single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such as E, T, X, T2)
A name in the form used for classes (see Class names), followed by the capital letter T (examples: RequestT, FooBarT).
Camel case: defined
Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case, such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like "IPv6" or "iOS" are present. To improve predictability, Google Style specifies the following (nearly) deterministic scheme.

Beginning with the prose form of the name:

Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, "Müller's algorithm" might become "Muellers algorithm".
Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens).
Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., "AdWords" becomes "ad words"). Note that a word such as "iOS" is not really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply.
Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of:
... each word, to yield upper camel case, or
... each word except the first, to yield lower camel case
Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.
Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded. Examples:

Prose form	Correct	Incorrect
"XML HTTP request"	XmlHttpRequest	XMLHTTPRequest
"new customer ID"	newCustomerId	newCustomerID
"inner stopwatch"	innerStopwatch	innerStopWatch
"supports IPv6 on iOS?"	supportsIpv6OnIos	supportsIPv6OnIOS
"YouTube importer"	YouTubeImporter
YoutubeImporter*	
*Acceptable, but not recommended.

Note: Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for example "nonempty" and "non-empty" are both correct, so the method names checkNonempty and checkNonEmpty are likewise both correct.

Programming Practices
@Override: always used
A method is marked with the @Override annotation whenever it is legal. This includes a class method overriding a superclass method, a class method implementing an interface method, and an interface method respecifying a superinterface method.

Exception:@Override may be omitted when the parent method is @Deprecated.

Caught exceptions: not ignored
Except as noted below, it is very rarely correct to do nothing in response to a caught exception. (Typical responses are to log it, or if it is considered "impossible", rethrow it as an AssertionError.)

When it truly is appropriate to take no action whatsoever in a catch block, the reason this is justified is explained in a comment.

      try {
          int i = Integer.parseInt(response);
          return handleNumericResponse(i);
      } catch (NumberFormatException ok) {
          // it's not numeric; that's fine, just continue
      }
      return handleTextResponse(response);
    
Exception: In tests, a caught exception may be ignored without comment if it is named expected. The following is a very common idiom for ensuring that the method under test does throw an exception of the expected type, so a comment is unnecessary here.

      try {
          emptyStack.pop();
          fail();
      } catch (NoSuchElementException expected) {
      }
    
Static members: qualified using class
When a reference to a static class member must be qualified, it is qualified with that class's name, not with a reference or expression of that class's type.

      Foo aFoo = ...;
      Foo.aStaticMethod(); // good
      aFoo.aStaticMethod(); // bad
      somethingThatYieldsAFoo().aStaticMethod(); // very bad
    
Finalizers: not used
It is extremely rare to override Object.finalize.

Tip: Don't do it. If you absolutely must, first read and understand Effective Java Item 7, "Avoid Finalizers," very carefully, and then don't do it.

Javadoc
Formatting
General form
The basic formatting of Javadoc blocks is as seen in this example:

      /**
       * Multiple lines of Javadoc text are written here,
       * wrapped normally...
       */
      public int method(String p1) { ... }
    
... or in this single-line example:

      /** An especially short bit of Javadoc. */
    
The basic form is always acceptable. The single-line form may be substituted when there are no at-clauses present, and the entirety of the Javadoc block (including comment markers) can fit on a single line.

Paragraphs
One blank line—that is, a line containing only the aligned leading asterisk (*)—appears between paragraphs, and before the group of "at-clauses" if present. Each paragraph but the first has <p> immediately before the first word, with no space after.

At-clauses
Any of the standard "at-clauses" that are used appear in the order @param, @return, @throws, @deprecated, and these four types never appear with an empty description. When an at-clause doesn't fit on a single line, continuation lines are indented four (or more) spaces from the position of the @.

The summary fragment
The Javadoc for each class and member begins with a brief summary fragment. This fragment is very important: it is the only part of the text that appears in certain contexts such as class and method indexes.

This is a fragment—a noun phrase or verb phrase, not a complete sentence. It does not begin with A {@code Foo} is a..., or This method returns..., nor does it form a complete imperative sentence like Save the record.. However, the fragment is capitalized and punctuated as if it were a complete sentence.

Tip: A common mistake is to write simple Javadoc in the form /** @return the customer ID */. This is incorrect, and should be changed to /** Returns the customer ID. */.

Where Javadoc is used
At the minimum, Javadoc is present for every public class, and every public or protected member of such a class, with a few exceptions noted below.

Other classes and members still have Javadoc as needed. Whenever an implementation comment would be used to define the overall purpose or behavior of a class, method or field, that comment is written as Javadoc instead. (It's more uniform, and more tool-friendly.)

Exception: self-explanatory methods
Javadoc is optional for "simple, obvious" methods like getFoo, in cases where there really and truly is nothing else worthwhile to say but "Returns the foo".

Important: it is not appropriate to cite this exception to justify omitting relevant information that a typical reader might need to know. For example, for a method named getCanonicalName, don't omit its documentation (with the rationale that it would say only /** Returns the canonical name. */) if a typical reader may have no idea what the term "canonical name" means!

Exception: overrides
Javadoc is not always present on a method that overrides a supertype method.
